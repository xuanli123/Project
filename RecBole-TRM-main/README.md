Because the limitation of Git, I need to submit the dataset to other plateforms, BaiduCloud. So, user cannot run the program directly. Afted downloading the needed dataset, user could run the program successfully.
Description of the dataset: there are three kinds of dataset. I use the mind_small_train to test. You could check my computer information in the report. If your computer is better, you could choose the dataset in the dataset file. There are more larger files in it. If your computer cannot run it, you could use the ml-100k. This is the smallest one.
